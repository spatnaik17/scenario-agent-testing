# Debug Mode [Step through scenarios interactively]

Debug mode allows you to step through scenarios interactively, inspecting agent responses and intervening with your own inputs. This is invaluable for understanding how your agent behaves and debugging issues in complex conversations.

:::info
Debug mode is only available in the Python SDK for now, TypeScript support is coming soon.
:::

## What is Debug Mode?

Debug mode pauses scenario execution before each user message, allowing you to:

- **Step through conversations**: See exactly how the dialogue unfolds
- **Intervene with custom messages**: Override the user simulator with your own inputs
- **Test edge cases**: Try specific inputs that might cause issues
- **Understand failure modes**: See where and why scenarios fail

## Enabling Debug Mode

### 1. Global Configuration

Enable debug mode for all scenarios:

```python
import scenario

# Enable debug mode globally
scenario.configure(debug=True)

# Run any scenario - it will now be interactive
result = await scenario.run(
    name="debug test",
    description="User asks for help",
    agents=[
        MyAgent(),
        scenario.UserSimulatorAgent(),
        scenario.JudgeAgent(criteria=["Agent is helpful"])
    ]
)

assert result.success
```

### 2. Per-Scenario Configuration

Enable debug mode for specific scenarios:

```python
# Debug only this scenario
result = await scenario.run(
    name="debug specific test",
    description="User has a complex request",
    agents=[MyAgent(), scenario.UserSimulatorAgent(), scenario.JudgeAgent()],
    debug=True  # Enable debug mode just for this test
)

assert result.success
```

### 3. Command Line (with pytest)

Enable debug mode from the command line:

```bash
# Enable debug mode for all tests
pytest tests/ --debug -s

# Run specific test with debug mode
pytest tests/test_my_agent.py::test_specific_scenario --debug -s
```

:::tip
Always use the `-s` flag with pytest in debug mode to see the interactive prompts properly.
:::

## Using Debug Mode

### Interactive Prompts

When debug mode is enabled, you'll see prompts like this:

```
[Scenario: weather query] [Debug Mode] Press enter to continue or type a message to send
[Scenario: weather query] User:
```

You have two options:

1. **Press Enter**: Let the user simulator generate the next message automatically
2. **Type a message**: Override the user simulator with your custom input

### Example Session

Here's what a debug session looks like:

```bash
$ pytest tests/test_weather_agent.py --debug -s

[Scenario: weather query] [Debug Mode] Press enter to continue or type a message to send
[Scenario: weather query] User: What's the weather like today?

[Scenario: weather query] Agent: I'd be happy to help you with the weather! However, I need to know your location first. Could you please tell me what city or area you're asking about?

[Scenario: weather query] [Debug Mode] Press enter to continue or type a message to send
[Scenario: weather query] User: I'm in New York

[Scenario: weather query] Agent: Let me get the current weather information for New York.

ðŸ”§ Tool Call: get_current_weather(city="New York")
ðŸ“‹ Tool Response: {"temperature": "72Â°F", "condition": "partly cloudy", "humidity": "65%"}

[Scenario: weather query] Agent: The current weather in New York is partly cloudy with a temperature of 72Â°F and humidity at 65%. It's quite pleasant today! Is there anything specific about the weather you'd like to know more about?

[Scenario: weather query] [Debug Mode] Press enter to continue or type a message to send
[Scenario: weather query] User:

âœ“ Scenario completed successfully
```

## Combining Debug Mode with Scripts

Debug mode works also with scripted scenarios:

```python
def check_tool_call(state):
    assert state.has_tool_call("get_weather"), "Agent should call weather tool"

result = await scenario.run(
    name="scripted debug test",
    description="User asks about weather",
    agents=[WeatherAgent(), scenario.UserSimulatorAgent(), scenario.JudgeAgent()],
    debug=True,
    script=[
        scenario.user(),  # Debug prompt appears here
        scenario.agent(),
        check_tool_call,  # Validation runs automatically
        scenario.user(),  # Another debug prompt
        scenario.succeed()
    ]
)

assert result.success
```
