# Multimodal Use Cases – Overview

Many modern agents must process more than just text. Scenario supports tests where your agent receives **images**, **files**, **audio**, and other modalities – individually or combined.

This section shows how to structure such tests, common pitfalls, and best-practices for reliable evaluation.

## Available Guides

- [Voice Agents](/examples/multimodal/testing-voice-agents) – testing agents that listen to audio, think, and respond with either text _or_ audio.
- [Images](/examples/multimodal/multimodal-images) – testing agents that process multiple images along with user messages.
- [Files](/examples/multimodal/multimodal-files) – _coming soon_ (PDF, CSV, etc.).

:::tip
**Image Generation Testing**: Unlike processing existing images, image generation tests evaluate the agent's ability to create images from text prompts. The judge can analyze both the prompt quality and the generated image quality, making this a powerful way to test creative AI capabilities.
